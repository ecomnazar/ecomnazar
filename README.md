## <p align="center"> 💻 About me:</p>

<p>
I easily find a common language with people, adequately calculate my strengths, if understand that I’m not keeping up somewhere, I’ll let you know right away, and my approach to work and study is that if I stop in one place, I try to solve everything myself for the first 2 hours (Google , stackoverflow, documentation) and only then ask for help
